# 08/27-currency-converter

This project is all about developing a full-stack currency converter application that can be used to easily convert between different currencies.

This will be a full stack project, will build frontend as well as api which can be used independently. I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) with [zod](https://zod.dev/) and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). also will use this api to fetch latest currency prices [https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api).
